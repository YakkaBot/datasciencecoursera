##Transformations
The run_analysis.R script performs the following actions.

#### Read common files and create descriptive variable names.
* Read the activity labels from the "activity_labels.txt" file.
* Read the feature names from the "features.txt" file.
* Remove all columns from the features that are not mean or standard deviation.
* Expand the feature names so they are more descriptive.
* Replace any non-alpha numeric characters so the feature variables are syntactically valid.

#### Read and clean the "Test" data set.
* Read the Test subjects from the "Test/subject_Test.txt" file.
* Relabel the column in the TestSubjects data set to "subjects"
* Read the Test activity data set from the "Test/Y_Test.txt" file.
* Relabel the column in the Test activity data set to "activity"
* Replace the activity references with activity names.
* Read the Test experiment data set from the "Test/X_Test.txt" file.
* Remove Columns that are not needed
* Relabel the columns in the Test data set to match the features.
* Combine the Test columns in to the 'cleanTest' dataset.

#### Read and clean the "Train" data set.
* Read the Train subjects from the "Train/subject_Train.txt" file.
* Relabel the column in the TrainSubjects data set to "subjects"
* Read the Train activity data set from the "Train/Y_Train.txt" file.
* Relabel the column in the Train activity data set to "activity"
* Replace the activity references with activity names.
* Read the Train experiment data set from the "Train/X_Train.txt" file.
* Remove Columns that are not needed
* Relabel the columns in the Train data set to match the features.
* Combine the Train columns in to the 'cleanTrain' dataset.

#### Combine Test and Train data sets.
* Combine the CleanTest and cleanTrain data sets in to the new data set cleanDataSet.
